    <h1> My FRIENDS</h1>
    <h3>What friendship means to me?</h3>
    <p>All of us have met lot's of people, but not every <br>
        becomes a friend, not talking about best friends.<br>
        So who actually does? It's, of course, people,<br>
        who understand us, and if they cannot they try.<br>
        True friendship goes through difficulties,emotions, <br>
        sometimes opposite qualities and you both fight <br>
        the problems, not each other.
